# es6-module

My own personal ES6 module boilerplate.

`git clone` and `npm install` to use. 

## About

This project is so you can easily create new JavaScript modules that have a few of the basic things you might need: A build process, unit tests, linting, and documenting. 

Modules are written in ES6 using these technologies:

- Webpack / Babel
- Mocha for testing
- ESLint for linting
- ESDoc for documenting

## Commands

| `npm run start`  | Build src > dist folder and watch for changes. |
|----------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| `npm run dist` | Build src -> dist folder. |
| `npm run lint` | Run the linter. |
| `npm run test` | Run the tests. |
| `npm run docs` | Generate documentation. |
